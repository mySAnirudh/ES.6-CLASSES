    **Introduction of new version of JavaScript (ES6) introduced the use of 
    classes instead of functions.Classes are similar to functions.They use
     class keyword instead of function keyword. They use constructor method 
     to initialise. How to remove all classes that begin with a certain string
      in JavaScript? What are the classes and proxies in JavaScript 


   Object Orientation is a software development paradigm that follows real-world 
modelling. Object Orientation, considers a program as a collection of objects that 
communicates with each other via mechanism called methods. ES6 supports these 
object-oriented components too.
Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
To begin with, let us understand 
 Object: An object is a real-time representation of any entity. According to Grady 
Brooch, every object is said to have 3 features:
o State: Described by the attributes of an object.
o Behavior: Describes how the object will act.
o Identity: A unique value that distinguishes an object from a set of similar 
such objects.
 Class: A class in terms of OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. A class 
encapsulates data for the object.
 Method: Methods facilitate communication between objects.
Let us translate these Object-Oriented concepts to the ones in the real world. For example:
A car is an object that has data (make, model, number of doors, Vehicle Number, etc.) 
and functionality (accelerate, shift, open doors, turn on headlights, etc.)
Prior to ES6, creating a class was a fussy affair. Classes can be created using the class
keyword in ES6. 
Classes can be included in the code either by declaring them or by using class expressions.
Syntax: Declaring a Class
class Class_name
{
}
